# Smart Garden
The smart garden project at Evertz. A zone-divided raised garden bed is operated using motorized valves controlled by a microntroller and interfaced with an internally hosted website.

Start by cloning the project to your folder of choice (I like to have it in C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents) by running `git clone https://github.com/mcassar4/SmartGarden.git`
