## Backend

This project has two ports and processes open, one for the backend and one for the frontend. This code is strictly for the backend.

### `npm install`

Installs all of the packages necessary since we are not committing the build folder.

### `npm start ./server.js`

Launches the backend.

### 'Frontend Integration'

The backend has not interface, which is intentional behavour. Going to the endpoint /queue will show what the ESP and frontend are interfacing with. See ../frontend/README.md for instructions on how to run the frontend.
