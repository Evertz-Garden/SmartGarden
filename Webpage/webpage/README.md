## Frontend

This project has two ports and processes open, one for the backend and one for the frontend. This code is strictly for the frontend.

### `npm install`

Installs all of the packages necessary since we are not committing the build folder

### `npm start`

Launches the frontend.

### 'Backend Integration'

The frontend will appear to be empty with an error message of it is not connected to the backend. This is intentional behavour. see ../backend/README.md for instructions on how to run the backend
