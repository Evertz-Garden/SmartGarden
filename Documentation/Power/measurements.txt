Measurements and calculations to help with part selection

Valves:                                        @12V=
Peak current draw when opening: 300mA               3.6W
Average current draw when opening: 150mA            1.8W * (10s)/(3600s/h)
Time to open: <10s
Current draw while holding valve open: 50mA         0.6W * watering time
**The blue lead is positive
**These have a safety margin of ~1.5x

ESP32:                                          @5V=
Passive draw: 50mA                                  0.25W
