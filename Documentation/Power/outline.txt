Outline of Power Group goals and strategy

The smart garden system should run off-the-grid using a solar panel and battery backup to supplement on cloudy days.
The battery should be sufficiently sized to allow the system to run for 4 days with no incoming charge, and the solar
panel should be able to recharge the battery within a day of sunlight. 

Two voltages are needed for the garden: 12V for the relays and 5V for the MCU. 
High Voltage (12V):
-As 3.6-4.2V 18650 cells are plentiful, lots of off-the-shelf battery management systems exist for
varying sizes of packs. Using a 3S (3 series) pack of 4.2V 18650s gives a pack voltage of 12.6V,
and based on a typical capacity of mAh, gives Wh of capacity.
-Solar panels with 10s of watts are available on Amazon, and also run on 12V. 12V MPPT boards are
widespread, like 12V BMSs.
-The ball valves themselves open when 12V is applied. Relays will be needed to enable and disable
this power based on signals from the MCU. Need to be careful to isolate MCU from any HV- an H-bridge
or similar driver may be needed, I need to look deeper into relays.

Low Voltage (5V):
-A buck converter can be used to efficiently transform 12V to 5V for use by the microcontroller.
