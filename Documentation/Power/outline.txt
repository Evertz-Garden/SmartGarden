Outline of Power Group goals and strategy

The smart garden system should run off-the-grid using a solar panel and battery backup to supplement on cloudy days.
The battery should be sufficiently sized to allow the system to run for 4 days with no incoming charge, and the solar
panel should be able to recharge the battery within a day of sunlight. Focus on parts that ship faster over lower cost.

Two voltages are needed for the garden: 12V for the relays and 5V for the MCU. 
High Voltage (12V):
-For long term applications with varying charge times like solar, lithium batteries are not ideal.
Lead acid batteries suit the application better, and have standard charge controllers available.
-The ball valves themselves open when 12V is applied. Relays will be needed to enable and disable
this power based on signals from the MCU. Need to be careful to isolate MCU from any HV.

Low Voltage (5V):
-A buck converter can be used to efficiently transform 12V to 5V for use by the microcontroller and the relay coils.
